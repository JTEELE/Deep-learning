>### Getting Started:
>> 
- Standard python file can be run using Git bash or command line prompt:

```bash
python main.py
```

>### Overview: 
>> This script will *build* & *evaluate* deep learning models using two variables, the Fear & Greed (FNG) values and simple closing prices, to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than the normal closing price data.

>> One model will use the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model will use a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price.

As with traditional trading markets, the crypto greed and fear index ranges from zero to 100, indicating when investors may be too greedy or fearful.
